    <h3>A dating app meant for knowing what you want and like.</h3>
    <p>
    I can be technical about this but lets keep this casual.

Dating Apps sucks. I threw a dice on this project what can I say? Gotta start somewhere right?

Some dating apps don’t have what you want. like options to select a particular race/ethnicity or something simple as including intentions.
Some are just flooded with bots and unreal accounts. 
You don't want to waste time with something you don't like or have trouble with, right?
</p>

    <div className='study-need'>
    <h3>Need</h3>
    <p>With diversity at an all time high, how can all users feel like their needs are being met
     when most conventional dating apps don’t cater to finding their soul mate?
    
</p>
    </div>
    <div className='study-solve'>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
<p>We created a dating app based on inclusitivity for all genders, race, nationalities,
intentions, and ages to find and meet their significant others.
Inspired by dating apps that don’t fit the bill for certain groups, U Down 
is specifically designed to be up front with what you want.
From your type up to your intentions, U Down looks to help make it easier for you to get the person you've wanted for you. </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Inspired by dating apps that don’t fit the bill for certain groups, U Down 
is specifically designed to be up front with what you want.
From intention to up to your type, U Down looks to reach everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div className='study-waythink'>
    <h3>Way of Thinking</h3>
<p>The overall approach was to not only cater to all users, but to engage them in a different way from our competitors. 
Setting an intention and selecting a particular ethnicity/race allows more clarity for and to convey what a user 
wants.
Mechanics wise, swiping left and right was the most common interaction when using a dating app. 
Instead of left as no or right as yes, we chose up as no, and down as yes,
to add a little more interactivity with the overall experience. 
It also went along with the name of the app project itself, and thought it would be a fun way to users to be engaged.

</p>
    </div>
    <div className='study-research'>
    <h3>Research/Testing</h3>
<p>The User Research I conducted was a hands-off model that allowed users to interact
 with the dating app as they pleased. I created prompts for them to follow along
  with neutral questions to allow the users to express how they felt about using it. 
The assumptions I made before the research for the app was for it
 be universally approved and easy to use. After the research, my
assumptions have been humbled as the app is still yet to be fully completed. 
</p>
<h5>Observations</h5>
<p><span>Screen interaction</span></p>
<p>Users found it difficult using the novel swiping method and preferred to have it be more accessible by thumb or finger</p>
<p><span>More Preferences</span></p>
<p>We found that although the focal point of the app was addressed, they would've liked to see more traits in common 
like hobbies and food locations frequentedr</p>
<p><span>Too Straightforward</span></p>
<p>Although we were solving a problem, the whole user experience was unfulfilling to the user as it didn't provide many micro interactions to keep the 
users engaged throughout using the app. We believe that a new page should be built for minigames and interacting with users through there. </p>

    <div className='study-struggles'>
    <h3>Struggles</h3>
    <p>
</p>
<p>My first design project:
Using Figma for the first time wasn't bad. 
Enjoyed the process thoroughly and was a great starting point. 
Not skipping the design process. Very important

Wireframes:
Yeah I designed over my wireframes without a backup <span>Yeah I didn't know about components at the time</span>
Rookie mistake, but we have our moments. 
</p>
    </div>
    <div className='study-lessons'>
    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Documentation and consistency is key.
Like with all projects, its good to have a good plan. 
Be open to learn. Seriously this helps. 
    Have fun and play with the process. Don't be afraid to experiment and get down with it.
